It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.\nGson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source-code of.\n\nThere are a few open-source projects that can convert Java objects to JSON. However, most of them require that you place Java annotations in your classes; something that you can not do if you do not have access to the source-code. Most also do not fully support the use of Java Generics. Gson considers both of these as very important design goals.\n\n### Goals\n  * Provide simple `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods to convert Java objects to JSON and vice-versa\n  * Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON\n  * Extensive support of Java Generics\n  * Allow custom representations for objects\n  * Support arbitrarily complex objects (with deep inheritance hierarchies and extensive use of generic types)\n\n### Download\n\nGradle:\n```gradle\ndependencies {\n  implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.5'\n}\n```\n\nMaven:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>\n  <artifactId>gson</artifactId>\n  <version>2.8.5</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n[Gson jar downloads](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.google.code.gson/gson) are available from Maven Central.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/gson.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/gson)\n\n### Documentation\n  * [API Javadoc](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson): Documentation for the current release\n  * [User guide](https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/UserGuide.md): This guide contains examples on how to use Gson in your code.\n  * [Change log](https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md): Changes in the recent versions\n  * [Design document](https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/GsonDesignDocument.md): This document discusses issues we faced while designing Gson.

This library was created to be included in [OpenGApps App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.opengapps.app). There are too many storage chooser out there but this one is too materially :stuck_out_tongue: . Easy to implement and does not take a lot of your valueable time in setting-up all the other necessary things that every developer seeks, like\n\n- saving path to sharedPreference\n- event when path is selected and act upon that path\n- and much more.\n\nThere are also some really nice features that I thought would come in handy:\n\n- You show a quick overview of the storages present and their memory available before choosing so that users know which storage to choose.\n- you can choose between _sheet and sleek_ layouts.\n- Inline create folder view _(not another dialog to handle)_\n- Full localization. I mean literally every strings can be localized to your desired language.\n- Memory thresholding - a restriction or a toast that it shows when user's memory is less than your defined memory for operations.\n- and more will be added soon.\n\n\n\nPreview\n-------\n\n![SC Features](http://i.imgur.com/nmqPJok.gif)\n\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nAdd this to your root build.gradle file under repositories:\n\n    allprojects {\n\t\trepositories {\n\t\t\tmaven { url \"https://jitpack.io\" }\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\nAdd this to your app level build.gradle as dependency:\n\n    com.github.codekidX:storage-chooser:2.0.4.2\n\n\nNotes\n-----\n\nBefore you implement this library here are some notes that you can follow to avoid errors.\n\n> **Confirm:**\n\n> - You have asked for **Runtime Permission** from the user in the past to avoid read errors.\n> - Permissions with \"READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" and \"WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" is enough for this library to work.\n> - This library follows same color scheme as that of the parent app to maintain the aesthetic of the parent app. _See the color scheme section below_\n\n\nImplementation\n--------------\n\n\n## List of configuration for StorageChooser.Builder\n\nYou can have the following configuration of builder.\n\n| methods | parameters | compulsary? |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| withActivity | Activity  | Yes |\n| withFragmentManager | FragmentManager _(legacy)_ | Yes |\n| withMemoryBar | boolean | No |\n| hideFreeSpaceLabel | boolean | No |\n| withPreference | SharedPreferences | actionSave(true) |\n| withPredefinedPath | String | No |\n| **setType** | StoragChooser.DIRECTORY_CHOOSER **_or_** StorageChooser.FILE_PICKER| allowCustomPath(true) |\n| showHidden | boolean | No |\n| setTheme | StorageChooser.Theme | No |\n| skipOverview | boolean, String | No |\n| skipOverview | boolean | No |\n| withContent | com.codekidlabs.storagechooser.Content | No |\n| customFilter | ArrayList<String> | No |\n| filter | StorageChooser.FileType | No |\n| shouldResumeSession | boolean | No |\n| setHeadingTypeface | String, boolean | No |\n| setListTypeface | String, boolean | No |\n| disableMultiSelect | NONE | No |\n\n### Simple Type\n\n- Let's you toggle between inernal/external root directory.\n\n```\n// ~\n\n// Initialize Builder\nStorageChooser chooser = new StorageChooser.Builder()\n.withActivity(MainActivity.this)\n.withFragmentManager(getFragmentManager())\n.withMemoryBar(true)\n.build();\n\n// Show dialog whenever you want by\nchooser.show();\n\n// get path that the user has chosen\nchooser.setOnSelectListener(new StorageChooser.OnSelectListener() {\n    @Override\n    public void onSelect(String path) {\n        Log.e(\"SELECTED_PATH\", path);\n    }\n});\n```\n\n> OUTPUT: **/storage/emulated/0**\n\n### Pre-defined Type\n\n- Let's you append a specific path to the root of internal or external directory.\n\n```\n// --- ADD --\n.withPredefinedPath(STATIC_PATH)\n```\n\n> OUTPUT: **/storage/emulated/0/Downloads/CodekidLabs**\n\n### Custom Type\n\n- Let's your user choose custom directory/file.\n\n#### Directory Chooser\n\n```\n// --- ADD ---\n.allowCustomPath(true)\n.setType(StorageChooser.DIRECTORY_CHOOSER)\n```\n\n#### File Picker\n\n```\n// --- ADD ---\n.allowCustomPath(true)\n.setType(StorageChooser.FILE_PICKER)\n```\n\n### Save directly to preference\n\n```\n// --- ADD ---\n.actionSave(true)\n.withPreference(sharedPreferences)\n```\n\n### Get path from preference\n\n```\nString path = sharedPreferences.getString(DiskUtil.SC_PREFERENCE_KEY,\"\");\n```\n### (2.0) Theme\nA guide on how to set a theme is posted [here](https://github.com/codekidX/storage-chooser/wiki/A-Look-at-Storage-Chooser.Theme)\n### (2.0) File Filter\n\nFile filters are good and when your app is made for a specific purpose like choosing songs to be added in a playlist you might not want the user to go into the folders where there are no songs. Now you can add filter to builder instance like this\n`builder.filter(StorageChooser.FileType.AUDIO);`\nthis will filter out all folders containing audio files for you and thereby reducing some effort from user side.\n\nIn version *2.0.3*+, there is a support for custom file filters, all you need to do is create an `ArrayList<String>` of all the extensions without the `.` before it and send it to `builder.customFilter` function.\n\n| filter | extensions |\n| ------ | ------ |\n| StorageChooser.FileType.AUDIO | .mp3 .ogg |\n| StorageChooser.FileType.VIDEO | .mp4 .ts .mkv .avi .flv |\n| StorageChooser.FileType.IMAGES | .jpg .jpeg .png .gif .tiff |\n| StorageChooser.FileType.DOCS | .pdf .doc .docx .ppt .xls |\n\n### (2.0) Multiselect\n It's already in there you don't need to write any special code for it. Just make sure your type of chooser is of type FILE_PICKER.\n`builder.setType(StorageChooser.FILE_PICKER);`\n\n![](https://media.giphy.com/media/7AWKkgm9Nozw4/giphy.gif)\n\n## Localization\n\nA seperate localization wiki is posted [here](https://github.com/codekidX/storage-chooser/wiki/Localizing-your-chooser-using-Content)\n\nLICENSE\n-------\n\nThis project is licensed with the Mozilla Public License v2.\n\nIn practice, you can use this library as-is, with a notification of it being used. If you make any changes, you are required to publish your changes under a compatible license.\n\n\n### Support Storage Chooser\n\nThis is a community based project so help fixing bugs by adding your fixes to it by [Create pull request](https://github.com/codekidX/storage-chooser/pull/new/master)\n"  },  {    "name": "facebook/react",    "description": "A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.",    "creator": "facebook",    "license": {      "key": "mit",      "name": "MIT License",      "spdx_id": "MIT",      "url": "https://api.github.com/licenses/mit",      "node_id": "MDc6TGljZW5zZTEz"    },    "readme": "# [React](https://reactjs.org/) &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/LICENSE) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/facebook/react/master.svg?style=flat)](https://coveralls.io/github/facebook/react?branch=master) [![CircleCI Status](https://circleci.com/gh/facebook/react.svg?style=shield&circle-token=:circle-token)](https://circleci.com/gh/facebook/react) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html#your-first-pull-request)\n\nReact is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\n\n* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.\n* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.\n* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).\n\n[Learn how to use React in your own project](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).\n\n## Installation\n\nReact has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and **you can use as little or as much React as you need**:\n\n* Use [Online Playgrounds](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#online-playgrounds) to get a taste of React.\n* [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) as a `<script>` tag in one minute.\n* [Create a New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.\n\nYou can use React as a `<script>` tag from a [CDN](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html), or as a `react` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can find the React documentation [on the website](https://reactjs.org/docs).  \n\nCheck out the [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) page for a quick overview.\n\nThe documentation is divided into several sections:\n\n* [Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)\n* [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)\n* [Advanced Guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)\n* [API Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html)\n* [Where to Get Support](https://reactjs.org/community/support.html)\n* [Contributing Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html)\n\nYou can improve it by sending pull requests to [this repository](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org).\n\n## Examples\n\nWe have several examples [on the website](https://reactjs.org/). Here is the first one to get you started:\n\n```jsx\nfunction HelloMessage({ name }) {\n  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <HelloMessage name=\"Taylor\" />,\n  document.getElementById('container')\n);\n```\n\nThis example will render \"Hello Taylor\" into a container on the page.\n\nYou'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; [we call it JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a `<script>` tag, read [this section](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#optional-try-react-with-jsx) on integrating JSX; otherwise, the [recommended JavaScript toolchains](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) handle it automatically.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe main purpose of this repository is to continue to evolve React core, making it faster and easier to use.
